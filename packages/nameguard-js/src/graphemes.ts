/**
 * Splits the input string into what users perceive as "characters", called graphemes.
 *
 * This function extends the official Unicode grapheme splitting algorithm with additional features.
 * It matches the algorithm used by NameGuard which introduces user-friendly features like Hangul and invisible character splitting.
 *
 * Splitting is performed using the [text-segmentation](https://github.com/niklasvh/text-segmentation) library with added special Hangul treatment.
 * This makes it possible to handle strings with arbitrary Hangul Jamo sequences that most operating systems render as distinct graphemes.
 * Without this fix, some Hangul Jamo would be merged into one grapheme which would seem confusing to the user who sees them as separate.
 * See splitGraphemes.test.ts for examples.
 * This function also handles invisible characters within graphemes, ensuring they are split into separate graphemes for better clarity.
 *
 * This implementation is safe to use in all modern web browsers,
 * unlike the related browser API for splitting graphemes according to the Unicode standard,
 * which isn't supported by all browsers today.
 *
 * @param name - normalized domain name to split into graphemes
 * @returns - list of graphemes derived from the input
