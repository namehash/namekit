The NameGuard SDK is open source and can be installed using your dependency manager.

## Install

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @namehash/nameguard
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @namehash/nameguard
```

```bash Bun
bun add @namehash/nameguard
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @namehash/nameguard
```

</CodeGroup>

## Instantiate

NameGuard exports a singleton that can be imported that has the defaults instantiated already, these defaults are:

- URL: `https://api.nameguard.io`
- Network: `mainnet`

```ts
import { nameguard } from "@namehash/nameguard";
```

## Configure Chain

You can customize the chain used by using the `createClient` method, and passing your desired `network` &mdash; [See supported chains](/chains).

```ts
import { createClient } from "@namehash/nameguard";

const nameguard = createClient({
  network: "sepolia",
});
```

## Custom Client

If you're working locally with or have [self-hosted](/self-hosting) the NameGuard API, you'll need to update the `url` for the API by creating a custom client.

```ts
import { createClient } from "@namehash/nameguard";

const nameguard = createClient({
  url: "http://localhost:5000",
});
```
